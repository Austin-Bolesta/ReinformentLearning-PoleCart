# ReinformentLearning-PoleCart

This if the first step in a project to use a combination of computer vision and reinforcement learning to allow and alogrithm to learn how to balance a pole-cart using openai's Gym and tensorflow. policyGradCart.py uses a [policy gradient technique](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Policy_gradient_methods) to learn the best series of actions (a policy) to keep a pole which is rotating around an axis at one end, standing within 15 degrees of vertical. To do this the model controls the motion of a cart on a 1-D track to control the pole's dynamics. [OpenAi's CartPole enviorment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/).
